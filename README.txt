# kyushu_v01.f
# This code calculates the density structure of a fluid in 
# hydrostatic equilibrium in rapid uniform rotation. 
# It is applicable to uniform-density Jacobi ellipsoids, or 
# situations where the density is a known function of pressure. 
# Documentation detailing the use of kyushu to calculate the shape 
# of Haumea can be found here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2019arXiv190400522D/EPRINT_PDF

# Compile using gfortran and then run the executable with ./a.out
